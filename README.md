project over review :
-
- In this Netflix content analysis project, I explored a dataset containing information about Netflix’s global content library to uncover insights into content trends, growth over time, and audience targeting. Using Python for data cleaning and visualization tools like Tableau , I analyzed key metrics such as the distribution of movies vs. TV shows, content added per year, popular genres, ratings, and country-wise contributions. The project helped identify patterns in Netflix’s content strategy and provided valuable insights into viewer preferences and regional content availability.

Data Analysices:
-
In the data analysis phase of the Netflix project, I explored key patterns and trends in the dataset to derive actionable insights. I analyzed the distribution between movies and TV shows, identified the most common content ratings (like TV-MA, PG, etc.), and examined content additions over the years to understand Netflix’s content growth strategy. I also looked at country-wise contributions to highlight where most content is produced and which regions have the largest presence. Additionally, genre frequency was analyzed to uncover viewer preferences and dominant content types. These insights were visualized using interactive charts in Tableau to support business decisions regarding content planning and audience targeting.

Result:
-
As a result of the analysis, I discovered that Netflix's content library is predominantly composed of movies, but the number of TV shows has been steadily increasing over the years. The platform saw a significant spike in content addition around 2017–2020, indicating a major expansion phase. The United States emerged as the top content-producing country, followed by India and the United Kingdom. TV-MA and TV-14 were the most frequent content ratings, suggesting a focus on mature audiences. Additionally, Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries were the most popular genres. These insights can help Netflix and stakeholders understand viewer trends, regional strengths, and guide future content acquisition or production strategies.

Limitation :
-
One of the main limitations of the Netflix project was the dataset itself, as it only included metadata about shows and movies available on Netflix, without any user behavior or viewership data. This restricted the analysis to content trends rather than audience engagement or preferences. Additionally, some columns had missing or inconsistent values (e.g., date_added, country, director), which could impact the accuracy of certain insights. The data was also static and not updated in real time, so it might not reflect Netflix’s current content catalog. Lastly, the project did not include financial or licensing data, which could have provided deeper business context for content acquisition strategies.
